🚀 Real-Time Chat Application Built with Java Socket Programming 🗣️

Excited to share a recent project I worked on: a Real-Time Chat Application built using Java Socket Programming! 🎉

Project Description:

This Real-Time Chat Application enables multiple users to join a common chat room, send and receive messages instantly. It uses Java and Socket Programming to implement a client-server architecture where the server handles multiple clients and broadcasts messages in real-time.

🔹Server Side: The server listens for incoming client connections and broadcasts any received messages to all connected clients.

🔹Client Side: Each client connects to the server, sends messages, and receives instant updates from other clients.

The system is built to support multiple clients, with each one being able to chat in real-time with others in the same room.


Key Features:
✅ Multi-User Chat Room:

Multiple users can join the chat room and exchange messages in real-time.

✅ Instant Messaging: 

Messages are instantly broadcasted to all connected users, allowing seamless communication.

✅ Server-Client Communication:

A central server manages all client connections, ensuring smooth message flow.

✅ Scalable Architecture:

Dynamically handle multiple users without interruptions or server restarts.

Technologies Used:

🔹Java for the core logic and server-client communication.

🔹Sockets for enabling real-time communication between the server and clients.
